# Server Mappings

## Summary

This is a public mapping of server IPs <-> a pretty display name. This data is used extensively around Lunar Client, most notably when displaying server names (or "Private Server", if unknown) on the friends list. Historically, this mapping was handled internally, and server owners did not have a good way to manage data for their server.

## How do I add/update/remove a server?

Please feel free to open a PR against `servers.json` in this repository, and we'll review it as soon as possible. Once merged, Lunar Client services will update over the next hour.

## Can I use this data for ___?

Go for it.

## Any other questions?

Please contact us at https://support.lunarclient.com for any additional questions.
